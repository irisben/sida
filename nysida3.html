								<h3>The objective</h3>
								<p>The objective of this project was to design an object you can 3D print (additive manufacturing) but cannot fræst(!!!) (subtractive manufacturing) as well as 3D scanning an object.</p>
                                <hr />

								<h3>Preparation</h3>
                                <p>The first thing I did was look for inspiration for what I want to create. I googled “small 3D printing ideas” since we were only allowed to use 90 grams of material for our object. I browsed through various ideas and ended up wanting to make a bottle opener. I was a little worried the PLA material would not be strong enough to handle the force of opening a bottle so I googled ideas on how to prevent the opener from breaking and came across a design I though was really smart. The design contains a hole for a coin and the coin is then used to open the bottle. Here you can view the design I found online. </p>
                                
                                <h3>Execution</h3>
                                <p>I decided to draw my object in Fusion 360. I drew a parametric outline of my bottle opener which you can see, along with measurements, in the picture below:
                                </p>
                                
                                <p> <img src="images/Upptakari_teikning.png" alt="" style="width:540px;height:540;"> 
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Next, I extruded the sketch out — mm and drew a new sketch on the bottle opener for the hole for the coin. I decided to use the 5kr coin since that is all I could find and measure. The measurements of the coin were:…… and I created the hole in the same ones. Here you can see a picture of the bottle opener after extruding and making the hole. 
                                </p>
                                
                                
                                <p> <img src="images/Upptakari3D.png" alt="" style="width:540px;height:540;"> 
                                </p>

								<p> Before I could print my object I had to print a small test which checks for how long I can print between two foundations before it breaks. I was mostly interested in seeing if it could handle printing 25mm, because that is the diameter of the coin, which it could. 
                                </p>
                                <p> I exported the Fusion drawing as a 3ML file and opened it in Prusa….. . I decided to use Generic PLA and the type of printer I used is Original Prusa i3. Below you can see a picture with the settings in the software. I exported the file onto an SD card and inserted that into the printer. 
                                </p>
